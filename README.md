While building my personal website, I struggled with finding a unique way to display my projects. With this in mind, I decided to build an editorial style layout with CSS Grid using React.

In order to achieve this, I created a global grid layout with custom styling. I, then, created a separate page for each project with a description of the project, the mapping of how I came up with the ideas for design and code, the technologies used, and the big "Aha's" per project.

To render each projects data, I used React props to send the children component data to the appropriate parent component element.

To hone in on the basics, I decided against using libraries to build each section of this project and pushed myself to stick to the basics of code to achieve what I had in mind.

If you have any recommendations, I would love to hear them!!

Thanks for stopping by!
